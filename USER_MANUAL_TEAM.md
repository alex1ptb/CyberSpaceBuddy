# Cyberspace Buddy - Team Portal User Manual (Internal)

Welcome to the Cyberspace Buddy Team Portal! This guide is for internal team members to understand and utilize the portal for managing client projects, support, and internal operations.

_(Note: This manual describes the functionality of the current mocked-up Team Portal. Features will expand significantly with backend integration.)_

## 1. Accessing and Logging In

### 1.1. Portal URL

- The Team Portal is accessible at the internal URL: `/#/team-admin-portal` (this may vary based on deployment). This URL should not be shared externally.

### 1.2. Team Login

1.  Enter your assigned **Team Username/Email** (e.g., `team@cyberspacebuddy.com`).
2.  Enter your **Password** (e.g., `password`).
3.  Click "Sign In".

_(Authentication is currently mocked. A secure authentication system will be implemented with backend development.)_
