- **Responsibility:** QA, Product Owner.

### 3.4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

- **Focus:** Validating that the application meets user requirements and is fit for purpose.
- **Methodology:** Conducted by stakeholders (e.g., internal team members acting as clients, actual beta clients if available).
- **Responsibility:** Product Owner, Stakeholders.

### 3.5. Responsiveness Testing

- **Focus:** Ensuring UI adapts correctly to different screen sizes.
- **Tools:** Browser developer tools (device mode), physical devices.
- **Responsibility:** QA, Frontend Developers.

### 3.6. Cross-Browser Testing

- **Focus:** Ensuring consistent functionality and appearance across supported browsers.
- **Browsers:** Latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.
- **Responsibility:** QA.

### 3.7. Accessibility Testing (Basic)

- **Focus:** Keyboard navigation, visible focus indicators, basic screen reader compatibility (e.g., VoiceOver, NVDA).
- **Tools:** Manual checks, browser accessibility tools.
- **Responsibility:** QA, Frontend Developers.

## 4. Test Environment

- **Frontend (Current):** Local development environment (browser serving static files). Staging environment (e.g., Netlify, Vercel deploy preview) once available.
- **Backend (Future):** Development, Staging, Production environments.
- **Test Data:**
  - Mocked data as defined in `constants.ts` and component states for current phase.
  - (Future: A dedicated test database with varied data scenarios).

## 5. Test Deliverables

- This Test Plan document.
- Test Cases (Link to a separate document or tool, e.g., Google Sheets, TestRail).
  - Example: `TEST_CASES.md` or a shared spreadsheet.
- Defect Reports (managed via an issue tracker).
- Test Summary Report (at the end of each major testing cycle).

## 6. Defect Management

- **Tool:** GitHub Issues (or Jira, Trello, etc.).
- **Defect Lifecycle:**
  1.  **New:** Defect reported with clear steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, environment details, severity, and priority.
  2.  **Open/Assigned:** Acknowledged and assigned to a developer.
  3.  **In Progress/Fixed:** Developer is working on or has fixed the defect.
  4.  **Ready for Retest/Resolved:** Fix deployed to test environment, ready for QA revalidation.
  5.  **Closed:** Defect verified by QA and closed.
  6.  **Reopened:** If retest fails.
  7.  **Deferred/Won't Fix:** If the issue is postponed or not considered a defect.
- **Severity Levels:**
  - **Critical:** Blocks testing of a major feature or causes system crash.
  - **High:** Major functionality not working as expected.
  - **Medium:** Minor functionality not working or significant UI issue.
  - **Low:** Cosmetic issue or minor inconvenience.
- **Priority Levels:** (Determined by Product Owner/Project Manager)
  - **Urgent:** Must be fixed immediately.
  - **High:** Must be fixed before next release.
  - **Medium:** Should be fixed if time allows.
  - **Low:** Can be fixed in a future release.

## 10. Risks and Mitigation

| Risk                                           | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Plan                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Limited test devices for responsiveness        | Medium     | Medium | Use browser dev tools extensively; prioritize testing on most common device types.      |
| Mocked data doesn't cover all edge cases       | Medium     | Medium | Expand mock data based on test findings; acknowledge limitations until backend is live. |
| Changes in requirements during testing         | Medium     | High   | Implement a change control process; re-evaluate test scope and effort.                  |
| Lack of dedicated QA resources (if applicable) | High       | High   | Allocate specific time for dev team members to perform QA tasks; simplify test scope.   |
| Misinterpretation of mocked behavior           | Low        | Medium | Clear documentation in PRD; regular communication between dev, PO, and QA.              |
