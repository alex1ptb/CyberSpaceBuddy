## 3. Frontend Architecture

- **Framework/Library:** React 19.x (using ES Modules via esm.sh)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v3
- **Routing:** `react-router-dom` (HashRouter for static hosting compatibility)
- **State Management:**
  - Currently: React component state (`useState`, `useEffect`) and props drilling.
  - Future Consideration: React Context API for more global state or a lightweight state manager (e.g., Zustand) if complexity significantly increases.
- **Build System:** None explicitly defined for current ESM setup (relies on browser's native module loading).
  - Future Consideration: Vite or similar for bundling, optimization, and dev server features if project scales or requires more complex build steps.
- **Key Libraries (via esm.sh):**
  - `react`, `react-dom`
  - `react-router-dom`
  - `@google/genai` (for Gemini API interactions)
- **Component Structure:** Organized into `pages/` and `components/`. Shared icons in `components/icons/`. Constants and types are centralized.
- **API Communication (Current):**
  - `@google/genai` SDK for Gemini API.
  - No custom backend API calls yet (all portal data is mocked client-side).
- **API Communication (Future Backend):**
  - `fetch` API or a library like `axios` for making RESTful API calls to the custom backend.
  - Standardized request/response formats (JSON).
  - Error handling and loading states for API calls.

## 4. Backend Architecture (Conceptual - Future Implementation)

- **Purpose:** To provide data persistence, business logic, user authentication, and secure API endpoints for the Client and Team Portals.
- **Potential Technologies (To Be Decided):**
  - **Language/Framework:**
    - Node.js with Express.js or NestJS
    - Python with Django or Flask
    - Google Cloud Functions (for serverless approach)
  - **API Type:** RESTful APIs (primarily) or GraphQL (consider if complex data needs arise).
- **Key Modules/Services (Conceptual):**
  - **Authentication Service:** Handles user registration (team only), login, session management (JWTs or sessions).
  - **User Management Service:** Manages client and team member profiles, roles, and permissions.
  - **Project Management Service:** CRUD operations for projects, tasks, milestones.
  - **Communication Service:** Stores and retrieves messages between clients and team. Manages notifications.
  - **Billing Service:** Manages invoices (integrates with payment gateway).
  - **Support Ticket Service:** Manages creation and lifecycle of support tickets.
  - **File Management Service (Optional):** Secure storage and retrieval of project files (e.g., using Google Cloud Storage).

## 5. Database Design (Conceptual - Future Implementation)

- **Purpose:** To store all persistent application data.
- **Potential Database Systems (To Be Decided):**
  - **Relational (SQL):** PostgreSQL, MySQL (Good for structured data, transactions).
  - **NoSQL (Document):** Firestore, MongoDB (Good for flexible schemas, scalability).
- **Key Entities (Conceptual Tables/Collections):**
  - `Users` (id, email, password_hash, role - client/team, name, company_name, created_at, updated_at)
  - `Projects` (id, client_user_id, name, description, status, start_date, end_date, project_manager_id (team_user_id))
  - `Tasks` (id, project_id, name, description, status, assignee_id (team_user_id), due_date)
  - `Milestones` (id, project_id, name, target_date, status)
  - `Messages` (id, sender_user_id, receiver_user_id (or project_id/ticket_id for context), content, timestamp, is_read)
  - `Notifications` (id, user_id, text, link, timestamp, is_read)
  - `Invoices` (id, client_user_id, project_id, amount, status, due_date, payment_date, payment_gateway_ref)
  - `SupportTickets` (id, client_user_id, subject, description, priority, status, assigned_team_member_id, created_at, updated_at)
  - `Services` (Static or DB managed: id, title, description)
  - `ServiceRequests` (id, client_user_id, requested_services, description, status)
  - _(Relationships to be defined: e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many)_

## 6. API Design Principles (Future Backend)

- **RESTful:** Use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH).
- **Stateless:** Each request from client to server must contain all information needed to understand the request.
- **Resource-Oriented:** URIs should represent resources (e.g., `/api/projects`, `/api/projects/{projectId}/tasks`).
- **JSON for Data Exchange:** Requests and responses should use JSON.
- **Versioning:** Implement API versioning if significant changes are anticipated (e.g., `/api/v1/...`).
- **Authentication:** Secure API endpoints using tokens (e.g., JWT) or session-based authentication.
- **Authorization:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users can only access/modify data they are permitted to.
- **Consistent Error Handling:** Use standard HTTP status codes for errors (400, 401, 403, 404, 500) and provide clear error messages in JSON format.
- **Pagination & Filtering:** For list endpoints returning many items.
- **Documentation:** Use tools like Swagger/OpenAPI to document API endpoints.

## 7. Deployment Strategy (Conceptual)

- **Frontend:**
  - Can be hosted as a static site on platforms like:
    - Google Cloud Storage (with Cloud CDN)
    - Netlify
    - Vercel
    - GitHub Pages
  - Requires configuration for client-side routing (e.g., rewrite rules for SPAs if not using HashRouter).
- **Backend (Future):**
  - **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is preferred given initial user request.**
    - Cloud Run (for containerized applications)
    - App Engine (PaaS)
    - Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) (for more complex microservices)
    - Cloud Functions (for serverless functions)
- **Database (Future):**
  - Cloud SQL (for PostgreSQL/MySQL on GCP)
  - Firestore (NoSQL on GCP)
- **CI/CD (Future):**
  - Implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines (e.g., using GitHub Actions, Cloud Build) for automated testing and deployment.
- **Environment Variables:**
  - Manage API keys (Gemini, Payment Gateway) and other sensitive configurations using environment variables. `process.env.API_KEY` is critical.

## 8. Security Considerations

- **Authentication:**
  - Strong password policies (backend).
  - Secure storage of passwords (hashing and salting - backend).
  - Protection against brute-force attacks (rate limiting - backend).
- **Authorization:**
  - Implement robust RBAC to prevent unauthorized data access/modification (backend).
- **Data Transmission:**
  - HTTPS for all communication.
- **Input Validation:**
  - Validate all user inputs on both frontend and backend to prevent injection attacks (XSS, SQLi).
- **API Security:**
  - Protect API endpoints from common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
  - CORS configuration.
- **Dependency Management:**
  - Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Sensitive Data:**
  - Handle API keys and other sensitive information securely (environment variables, secure vaults). Do NOT hardcode secrets.
- **Client-Side Security:**
  - Be mindful of XSS if rendering user-generated content (though React helps mitigate this).
  - No sensitive logic or keys should reside purely client-side if they can be exploited.

## 9. Scalability and Performance (Future Considerations)

- **Backend:**
  - Design stateless services for easier horizontal scaling.
  - Use load balancers.
  - Optimize database queries (indexing, connection pooling).
  - Caching strategies (e.g., Redis, Memcached) for frequently accessed data.
- **Frontend:**
  - Code splitting and lazy loading of components/routes to reduce initial bundle size.
  - Optimize images.
  - Minimize re-renders (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback).
  - CDN for static assets.
- **Database:**
  - Read replicas for SQL databases.
  - Sharding if data volume becomes extremely large.

## 10. Monitoring and Logging (Future Considerations)

- **Backend:**
  - Implement comprehensive logging for requests, errors, and significant events.
  - Use monitoring tools (e.g., Google Cloud Monitoring, Prometheus, Grafana) to track application performance, server health, and error rates.
- **Frontend:**
  - Error tracking services (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket) to capture client-side errors.
  - Basic analytics for user behavior (if needed).
